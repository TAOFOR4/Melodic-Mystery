# Melodic Mystery ðŸŽµ

This project was created as part of the course <em>DH2642 Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web</em> at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (KTH), Stockholm. 

## Description

The project features a music trivia game, in which the user gets to choose between four interactive game modes: "Guess the Title", "Guess the Year", "Guess the Artist" and "Fill in the Lyrics". Each game mode is playable for four different genre options "Rock", "Pop", "Hip-Hop", "R&B", as well as one mixed option "All". 

One game, e.g., "Guess the Title" - "All", consists of five rounds, where the goal of each round is the correctly identify the title of the song based on a 15 second long audio snippet. Four song alternatives are given for each round.

After five rounds, the player is given a score based on how many songs they identified correctly, as well as how quickly they answered. The top five users gets their name on the leaderboard.

## Status

Please note that for the mid-project review, only the "Guess the Title" - "All" mode is available, and will be the displayed mode regardless of what the user selected.

## Code structure
